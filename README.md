Hand Gesture Recognition Using Deep Learning

Using deep learning techniques, this project seeks to create a hand gesture recognition model that can recognize and categorize various hand movements from picture or video data. The objective is to make gesture-based control systems and natural human-computer interaction possible. These systems can be used in a variety of contexts, including virtual reality, gaming, smart home controls, and accessibility for individuals with impairments.

The model will be trained and assessed using labeled photos of hand gestures from the Leap Gestures Recognition Dataset on Kaggle.
